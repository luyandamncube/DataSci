# Collaborative Filtering (CF)

* This is a technique used by recommender systems (algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users). 
* The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.
* For example, a collaborative filtering recommendation system for television tastes could make predictions about which television show a user should like given a partial list of that user's tastes (likes or dislikes)
